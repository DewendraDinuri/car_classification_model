## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Set up Python environment

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can install TensorFlow manually:

pip install tensorflow
```

Step 2: Run the project
Use the following command to run the classification model:

python main.py

What's Inside main.py?
The main.py script includes the following:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset

Building a classification model using TensorFlow/Keras

Training the model on the provided data

Evaluating the model's performance

(Optional) Saving the trained model for future use

Dependencies
Python 3.8 or higher

TensorFlow

NumPy

Pandas (if used for data handling)

Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
